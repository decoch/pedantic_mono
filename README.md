# pedantic_mono

[mono edition] Recommended lints for Flutter apps, packages, and plugins to encourage good coding practices.

Added a rule for flutter_lints that I think is even better.

Added https://github.com/mono0926/pedantic_mono/blob/main/lib/analysis_options.yaml rules in addition to [flutter_lints](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_lints).

## Usage

## Install

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  pedantic_mono: any
```

## Locate the analysis_options.yaml

1. Copy [analysis_options.yaml](https://github.com/mono0926/pedantic_mono/blob/master/example/analysis_options.yaml) to project root.
2. Add your rules if needed.
